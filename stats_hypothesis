Null hypothesis & Alternative hypothesis
- These are always mutually exclusive
- For Chi-square distribution it takes following form
	H0 = The data are consistent with specified distribition
	H1=  The data are not consistent with specified distribition

Significance level
- The probability of commitinhg type I error is called as Significance level
- Tyep I error occurs when researcher rejects the Null hypothesis when it is true.
- any value between 0 to 1 can be used

Test Method
- Chi-suare goodness of fit test

Degrees of freedom
- Its is the number of independent observations minus number of population parameters  those must be eextimated from sample data.

P-value
- It is the probability of observing the a sample statistic as extreme as test statistic

Test stastics
- A random variable

State hypothesis
Formulate analysis plan
Analyze data
Interpret results
- Reject null hypothesis if p-value is less than the significance level


When to use Chi-square goodness of fit test?

1. Sampling method is simple random sampling 
2. variable under study is categorical
3. Expected value of the number of sample observations in each level of the variables is atleast 5
