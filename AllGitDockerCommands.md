# Version control
Mercurial and git are distributed
Mercurial and git treat all repositories equal
Every operation in git is local , Everyone has complete history, No central authority.
Changes can be shared without server
Git branching is one o fthe most poweful feature of Git
Master isdefault branch created



# Git commands
"HEAD" is a symbolic name for the currently checked out commit. HEAD always points to the most recent commit which is reflected in the working tree. Most git commands which make changes to the working tree will start by chaning HEAD
Normally HEAD points to a branch name.
Detaching HEAD just means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch.
``` git checkout <sha>``` It will move the HEAD to the required commit.

3 stages in git
  1. Working directory
  2. Staging area (aka index)
  3. Repository (.git directory)

**Git Branching**
  1. git branch <branch name> <- create a branch
  2. git checkout -b <branch name> <- go to already created branch
  3. To **merge** a branch with master branch, first check out the master branch and then "git merge <branch name>"
  4. git branch -d <branch name> <- delete a branch
  5. If master branch has progressed before merging then it may cause conflicts. Also in this case merging create non linear structure. Solution is "REBASE"
                                    6. Rebase works in 2 steps. First undo changes on feature branch and then reapply changes on master branch HEAD
                                    7. git rebase master; git checkout master ; git merge <branch name>
  8. git branch -m <old branch> <new branch> <- rename a branch
  git branch -d <branch name> <- delete a branch
  git checkout -b <branch name> <sha> <- recover a branch
  ``` git branch -f main HEAD~3``` <- move main to 3 parents before HEAD by force 
  ```git reset <commit>``` Reset will move branch BACKWARDS in time to an older commit as if the commits after it were nerver made in first place.
  ``` git revert <commit>``` Git rever works great locally in rewriting the history but does not work for remote branches. In order to reverse changes and share those changes with otehrs use REVERT
 ``` git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>``` <- A way of saying I would like to copy a series of commits below my current location (HEAD). 
``` git rebase -i <commit> ``` <-  Interactive rebase with flexibility to select/deselect/edit/combine commits. Its alternative for cherry-pick
``` git rebase <base> <target>                                  
``` git commit --amend``` to edit the commit     
``` git checkout main^``` <- first parent
``` git checkout main^2``` <- second parent
``` git checkout HEAD~^2~2 <- combining traversal
``` git branch -b bugWork main^^2^ ``` <- combining 2 commands
``` git push ``` git push is opposite of git pull. push with no argument depends on push.defaults setting      
``` git pull --rebase ; git push``` <- used to take changes from remote to local. Merge with local and rebase. Then push to the remote.
- For locked remote main need to raise PULL REQUEST
**Git Tag(aka anchor)**
   - Branch is liek separate thread but tag is lake a label.
   - Use of tag is to mark the release points
   - Tags can not be checked out                               
   - $git tag <- lists tags
   - $git tag v1.0 -m "some message" <commit> <- create tag with a message at specified commit. If commit is not selected then at HEAD
   - $git tag -a v1.0 <- opens default editor for longer message
   - ``` git describe <ref>``` <- describes where you are relative to the closest anchor or tag. Output of describe is as <tag>_<num commits>_g<ref>.
 **Git stash**
  - Stash is temporary store
  - ```$git stash``` <- stores working dir temporarily to stash
  - ```$git stash list``` <- show all stash
  - ```$fit stash apply``` <- reapply recent shash
                                    
## GitHub   
- One repository where we all sync up our changes
- Remote server is just simply a Git repository
- Github is one example of remote repository
- ``` git remote add origin <github url>``` <- origin can be replaced with any other word like remote-branch
- ``` git remote ``` Get names of all remotes
- ``` git remote -v ``` get names and details of all remotes
- ``` git clone <github url> ``` <- pulls up the remote repository locally and sets up the connection information
- After cloning origin/master is new branch is created called as tracking branch
- ``` git pull origin ``` "Pull" is Fetch + merge in one step. Fetches changes from remote master branch and merges with local master branch.
- Fetch is between remote repository to local repository. Merge is between local repository to working directory.                                   
- If remote branch has some more commits compared to last pull then need to perform rebase after pull to get the commits lienar and then push. ``` git rebase master ```
- We always checkout the branch with which we want to merge.
- Mergning after rebase will keep the origin/master pointer in old place. Local main pointer will come to the latest commit
- ``` git push origin``` To publish the changes to remote branch. This moves remote the pointer to latest commit. We are in complete in sync with remote.
- Git will reject the push if remote has newer changes                                    
- Always **"PULL THEN PUSH"** 
- ```git branch -a ``` to view all branches
- ``` git remote rename <old name origin> <new name>``` <- to rename the remote branch
- ``` git remote rm <remote branch name>``` <- to remove the remote branch
- Remote branches reflect state of remote repository in local repository. Remote branches are on your local repository and not on remote repository. One can not work directly on remote branch instead detached HEAD mode is triggered on checkout
- Remote repositories have different naming convension <remote name>/<branch name>. origin/main will only update when remote updates. Till then work on detached HEAD mode   
-```git fetch``` Downloads commits present in remote but missing in local repository  and updates the remote branches point. It does not however change your main branch or change anything about how your file system looks right now
  
.gitignore is added to the base project directory(parallel to .git directory). Need to commit it to repository.

- ```git add .```
- ```git commit```
- ```git commit``` -am "<message>" #for already commited files only
- ```git rm``` <- To remove the file tracking  for changes
- ```git status``` <- displays state of working directory and staging area
- ```git log``` <- options like "--oneline", "--grep=<pattern>", "git log <file>"
- ```git push```
- ```git config --global user.name="mannoj"``` #set username at global level to track checkin
- ```git config --global user.email="mannoj@gmail.com"``` #set username at global level to track checkin
- ```git checkout <branchname>```
- ```git pull origin ```
- ```git branch -f master C6``` # move master branch to the C6 commit as parent
- ```git reset``` <- Its a permanent Undo. Dangerous than "revert". Resets staging area to most recent commit but leaves working directory unchanged.
- ```git revert``` <- Undoes a commited snapshot. Its a safe way to undo changes. Doesnot change the project history.
- ```git cherry-pick <commits>```
- ```git rebase -i HEAD~4```
- ```git stash```
- ```git stash pop```
- ```git mege --abort```

#IF need to discard all local changes and get to the master branch
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master

git fetch downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.

Then the git reset resets the master branch to what you just fetched. The --hard option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in origin/master
