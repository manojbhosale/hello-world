set

set = {}
list to set
union of sets (|)
intersection of sets (&)

Dictionaries
Implemented with hash tables. Resizable hashtables
key(any immutable type) and value(any type)
User:
	logical association between key and values
	fast lookup based on custom key is needed
	when data is being constantly mutated remember dictionaries are mutable.
	
dict.copy() <- shallow copy
dict(key,default=<def value>)
dict[<key>]
del dict
dict.clear
dict.has_key() <- removed in python 3
dict.items()
dict.values()
dict.keys()
dict.update(dict2)
dist.fromkeys(range(<N>))
list, dictionaries, set are mutable. String and tuples are immutable.


Default arguments can only be placed rightmost of the argument list.
In python funcrtions return None instead of void
Only list set and dictionaries can be updated in the function body.


variable number of arguments:
	tuple : *variableName
	dictionary: **variableName
	These variables should be last in the function declaration otherwise error.
	
Scope:
variable declared inside function are local in scope.
Global variables can be declared inside function with "global" keyword
Global variables can be modified outside the function.
The keyword global is only useful to change or create global variables in a local context, although creating global variables is seldom considered a good solution.

Lambda:

lambda p : p*2
x = lambda p : p*2 
x(5)

Lambda creates frame as in actual function
Used in functional programming

File handling:
	dir(object) <- lists all the methods or members of the object
	fileHandle = open("<file name>","modifier")
	File handling:
	dir(object) <- lists all the methods or members of the object
	fileHandle = open("<file name>","modifier")
	input: read(), readLines(), readLine()
	output: write(), writeLines()
	tell()
	seek()
	str = raw_input("enter stiring:") //raw_input() and input(). later tries to interpret input from user and former takes all as string.raw_input() is renamed to input() in python 3
	revstr = str[::-1]

List compreshensions and map function:
However, there are cases when you cannot use map() and have to use a list comprehension instead, or vice versa. When you can use both, then it is often preferable to use a list comprehension, because this is more efficient and easier to read, most of the time.


Package:
Can contain classes with functions and member variables.

Import:
With import statement, definition of the variables in current script will be overriden.

from someFile import ClassName
from someFile import memberName
from someFile import methodName


python check for the packages in th e paths stored in path variable.
import sys
sys.path()
sys.path.appen('<path to include>')

Mammals class is precompiled when imported for first time

jupyter magics:
%quickref
%cd
%time
%%perl
