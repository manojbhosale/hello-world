#Boot process
BIOS -> Level 1 bootloader [Master Boot Record (MBR)] -> Level 2 boot loader[ LILO, GRUB etc.] -> Kernel -> init

#Overview of boot process
• The system BIOS checks the system and launches the first stage boot loader on the MBR of the primary hard disk.
• The first stage boot loader launches the second stage boot loader from the /boot/ partition.
• The kernel is loaded into memory, which in turn loads any necessary modules and mounts the root partition read-only.
• The kernel hands control of the boot process to the /sbin/init program
• The /sbin/init program loads all services and user-space tools, and mounts all partitions listed in /etc/fstab.
• The user is presented with a login prompt for the freshly booted Linux system
