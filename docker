Environment in which the product is developed is diffent than the production environment. Like OS, Security policies, SSL certificates. java versions.

Development and testing occurs on containers and these are pushed to production so the issue related to incompatibility dont arise in production. This makes possible faster release model and multiple technology stack.

Avoids problems caused by multiple versions of same platform(python, java versions) on sinlge host. Docker orchestrates the containers. Configurations of containers/launching/ deleting.

Docker uses only host OS kernals. It does not have its own OS.

Image -> Libraries -> Application Code #What is Container?

Containers are application centric way to deliver high performance , scalable application on infrastructure of your choice.

Its more than app virtualization.

Difference between virtual machine and containers?
Virtual machines are for longer term.
Containers are not for long duration. create and distroy easily.
containers consume less resources.

Virtualization technology:
	Need to specify hardware like 1 GB RAM, and one HDD
	.vhdx image (VHD: virtual harddisk)
	Takes large space. ~1gb(windows) 400mb(Linux)
	
	Cons:
	Long time to boot up
	lesser modularity
	Fewer VMs on single server.
	Quite heavy
	Single entity works independently
	
Containerized technology:
	No Guest OS, No Hypervisor as in VM
	It use images of OS.
	Small in size. ~100Mb
	Have minimum from OS to run the application.
	On linux we can create only Linux containers. I.e. Only container of Host Type can be created.	
	We can use containers in VM
	If the containers are destroyed then we need to create new container from image.
	Running image is called as container
	On one server 50-60 VM created max
	VM ware - horizon software - allows to create 150 containers
	
	Pros:
	Multiple containers can commnicate with each other
	Multiple containers can refer to same image. Container optimization.
	How about MySQL data access through the container if  are on diferent container.-> create private network and register containers
	COntainer is future : physical servers(Past) -> Virtualization (Present)
	Docker is container management service.
	Build.Ship.Run distributed applications.
	Amazon EC2 is virtual machines
	UCP: universal control plane -> UI based management. Comes with enterprise
	Kinematic: UI based but basic compared to UCP
	Mar2016 docker cloud: create containers in docker cloud
	Mar17: Launched for production.
	Commnunity edition (CE): Command based 
	
	Learning curve:
		Why container?
		Docker installation
		Images and containers
		Docker file
		Docker compose
		Volumes and networks
		Docker swarms
		Docker cloud
		
	Installation:
		Requires 64bit OS
		In windows it will create Linux VM and everything is done within VM
		On windows for VM one needs to have HyperVisor. HW should support Hyper-V in turns to install Docker.
		1:04:03
		
		
		Client -> Docker_Host -> Registry
		Client :
			Docker application
			build/pull/run
			By default memory resource are shared between containers. Can sepcify memory to specific container
		DOCKER_HOST:
			Docker daemon orchestrates containers and images
			Computer running DockerEngine is the Docker Host
			In windows the Docker host is the VM . MobyLinuxVM
			In linux the machine will be docker host
		Registry:
			Docker regisrty. Docker Hub. official . All the images of docker. Images can be from one liner code to appliction to OS
			There can be unofficial repositories too.
			Server for Docker deamon to fetch the images or services
			Image: is the readonly layer of OS that never changes.
			Container:
			Self contained environment build using multiple images. Containers can be created from multiple images
			Docker file:
				A file containing docker commands to create containers from images
				nginx:Latest -> latest version of nginx
			
		Image will occupy HDD and containers will use memory
		Ports are connected to container. Container will be having seperate IP and treated as seperate machine.
		Decide IP of docker by configuring docker network Bridge is default network. Can create different network.
		Docker Hub:
			hub.docker.com
			Official repository provided by docker to share the images created by comunity members
			can have multiple images of same application like mysql. Prefer official images. Use images with higher stars. 
			>Docker pull mysql:latest
			>Docker pull mysql:8 #8 is called as tag
		docker images #list images locally available
		docker pull nginx
		docker rmi <imageid> #delete or remove images from docker hub
		docker inspect <imagename>
			
		Pull image from hub -> put it in host -> launch the containers
		
		Can maintain two versions of mysql  using containers.
		To persist the data but container is distroyed. We need to create volume which will be pointed by new container.
		"commit" is used create image from container
		
		repositories will be present in moby folder
		
	Why container?
		start mongodb databse and use it within application
		to start ansible server
		start mysql server
		test application on newer version of framework
		host LDAP server
		host wordpress server
	Running a container:
		One process per container
		application container and database container will communicate with the shared network. Docker network.
		If one container gets down then other can take over
		Container are short lived
		>docker image pull ubuntu
		>docker container run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu /bin/bash       #-it -> interactive terminal, bin-bash is command
		> docker container ls # list running containers
		>docker stop da  ##da initial of the container id
		> docker container pause da
		> docker container unpause da
		> docker container stop da
		> docker container ls
		> docker stop da
		> docker rm fc
		> docker ps # >docker container ls #are same
		
		>docker container run -d -p 8085:80 --name my_webserver nginx # in detached mode i.e. dont enter the container.-p fixed port.-P random port
		>docker port mywebserver #to see Nginx port
		>docker attach my_container  #get inside if outside container
		>docker stats #CPU,Memory ,Network usage
		>docker inspect container_name # PID is of mobyLinux as every container is running as a process
		>docker top <PID>
		
		##Docker class room
		
		docker compose # runs config yml file. can share the yml file to share the setup
				
		Image is about the layers. Starts from base image and creates image for each image change in the form of application install. repository update
		
		>docke container rm -f <ids>
		
		DockerFile # is for creating single custom image
		yml  #compose file is used to crate multiple containers
		
		>docker image build -t <acc name>/myImageName . # current directory of the image so "."
		
		Updating host file does not work as container is not build on latest files. Can be overcome.
		Pushing to the repository:
			>docker login
			>docker push myImageName
		
		#linux command
		cat /etc/issue
